Interface:
    Interface is very similar to an abstract class.
    A way to achieve abstraction for unrelated classes through implementation.
    It is a contract between unrelated classes. We can use it to achieve abstraction.
    All methods are public by default and abstract as well.

Encapsulation:
    This says that your variables should be private
