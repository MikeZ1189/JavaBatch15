Constructor - block of code similar to a method that is executed when we create an object.
    Why do we need it? - constructor initializes the object
    How to create a constructor? -
    1. Constructor name MUST be same as a class
    2. Constructor does not have return type

    Type of Constructors:
    1. Non argument()
    2. Parameterized

    "This" Keyword = is used to refer to the current object
        - "This" can be used with variables and methods
        - "This." used to refer to CURRENT the instance variables
            In situations when local variables have same name as instance -> we use this. to differentiate
            and refer to the instance variable

    "this" can be used to refer to the instance methods as well
    "this()" - can be used to call CURRENT class constructor
