Overriding:
    process when same method exists in super and subclass
    In order to achieve overriding, inheritance needs to happen
Why? - to provide flexibility
How do we implement?
    1. we need inheritance
    2. same signature (name+parameters)
    3. same return type
    4. access modifiers -> overriding method must have same level of visibility or higher

Final - keyword that identifies something is completed and no modifications can be done
Final can be used with:
                        variables- makes variables constant
                        methods - cannot override it
                        class - cannot be inherited

Abstraction - process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality
Why use it? - reduces complexity, improve maintainability and security
How to implement abstraction?
    By using abstract classes - we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction
    By using interfaces  - we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction (before Java 8 it was only 100%)

Abstract class -
    abstract - keyword that identifies something is incomplete
