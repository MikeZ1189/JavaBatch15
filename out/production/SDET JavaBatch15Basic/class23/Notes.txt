Method overriding:
    Method overriding happens when same method with different implementation exists in parent and child class.
    Constructors do NOT participate in inheritance

Why should we override a method:
    1) flexibility
        When we inherit from a class and if we don't like some methods we can modify them.
Rules:
    1) private methods and constructors can't be overridden because they don't participate in inheritance.
    2) If we want to override something we must recreate that exact method inside the child class and can
        have a different implementation only access modifier can be different. It can have more visibility
        than the method inside the parent class.

Note:
    1) Right click in editor inside your class and click on generate -> constructor -> select instance variables you want to create a constructor from
    2) control + O -> we get an option to override the available methods.

Final Keyword when used with a variable, the value will not be changed.
When used with method, no one can override that method.
When used with a class, no class can inherit from it.
