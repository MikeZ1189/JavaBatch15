Exception:
    Exception is an unwanted behavior which occurs at run time and makes our programs terminate abruptly.
Exception Handling:
    Exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to avoid runtime errors and helps us convert complex error messages
    to something simpler that a normal user can understand.

How do we implement exception handling in Java?
    We have new keywords and new blocks of code which allow us to handle exceptions in Java.
    Blocks of codes:
    1) try
    2) catch
    3) finally
    Keywords:
    4) throw
    5) throws

try block:
    in the try block we write the code which can throw an exception
catch block:
    contains the backup code, the code that we want to execute in case of failure. It can also contain
    code to simplify the error messages, it can also contain the code which might send a notification or an
    email to the developers or admins in case of failure.

how it works:
    We can have multiple catch blocks with one try block, Each handling a different error.
    We can also put a last catch block with Exception class to that if something goes wrong
    and there is no specific catch block to handle it, the exception one will handle it.


finally block:
    Finally block is always executed no matter what happens in the try block or catch block.
    We should put cleanup code inside the finally block like closing a browser, closing database connection etc.
