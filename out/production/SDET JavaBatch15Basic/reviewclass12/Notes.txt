Exception:
    Exception is an unwanted behaviour that occurs at runtime and it terminates the program abruptly.
    There are three main types of issues in java programs.
    1) Syntax errors
    2) Logical errors
    3) exceptions (runtime errors)
1) Syntax errors:
    Syntax errors occur when we do not follow the java syntax for example:
    - when we have to create a variable we must define its data type or use the var keyword
        if we don't do this we will get a syntax error.
        Syntax errors occur at the time of writing code. They do not allow us to compile the code.
    How to fix:
        use your IDEs to find and fix these issues.

2) Logical errors:
    Logical errors occur when the programs don't do things that they are supposed to do.
    For example, you write come code to click on a button but your programs instead clicks on a checkbox.
    You write code to print numbers from 0 to 10 but your programs only prints 0 to 9.
    How to fix:
        use the debugger

3) Exceptions (Runtime errors)
    are the errors which are produced at runtime. Here, code compiles fine but the moment you try to run your program it throws errors.
    How to fix:
        Read the error and take the help from the class whose exception is being thrown for example NullPointerException.

Exception Handling:
    Exception handling is finding and fixing runtime errors and coming up with ways to avoid these errors.

There are some keywords and blocks of code that we can use to avoid these exceptions.
1) We have
    1- Try
    2- Catch
    3- Finally
    4- Throws
    5- Throw
Try-Catch block:
    Helps us test the code by putting it inside the try block and if something goes wrong Java executes the associated catch
    block where we can put backup code or we can notify the admins.
