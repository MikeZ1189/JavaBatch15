Methods in Java:
method is a block of code, when called, performs a specific task
** Is just a collection of java statements (an instruction in java) and blocks of code lik if else loop printlns etc.

why should we learn about methods?
1) it allows us to simply large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them build those methods
   one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
2) Methods allow us to re-use code.
3) methods allow us to be flexible.

How can we create methods?
 There are 2 types of methods: Built-in and user defined

 Built-in Method: methods which are designed by Java developers (e.g. println() nextInt() Scanner class length()) present in String class
                  they are all built-in methods.

 User Defined Method: They're methods that we write.
                      Methods which return somehting when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called.

 int add(int a, int b){
 return a+b;
 }
 int--> return type of a method
 add--> name of the method
 (int a, int b)--> parameters of the method or the input to the method
 { } --> body of the method
 RULES:
 - return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match.
 - we can only assign methods to variable of same type.

 There are tree types of variables with respect to their scopes
 Local variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc. they are called local variables.
 Upside:
    Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should always try to write code with the help of local variables.
Downside:
    They can't be accessed outside the block in which they are created.They have very limited scope.



 Instance variables:
    All the variables which are created inside a class outside the methods are called instance variables.
Upside:
    We can use them in all the instance methods of that class. Their scope is larger than  local variables.
Downside:
    They stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables.



 Static variables:
    All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keyword are called static variables.
