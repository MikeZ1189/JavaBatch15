Set:
    Sets do not allow duplicate values. There are three main types of set
    HashSet
    LinkedHashSet
    TreeSet

HashSet: (most widely used)
    Upside: speed it's the fastest
    Downside: It does not maintain the insertion order
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: maintains the insertion order.
    Downside: Slower than HashSet
TreeSet:
    Upside: keeps the data sorted
    Downside: its slower than all

Map:
    Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets, we have three types of maps
    as well:
    HashMap
    LinkedHashMap
    TreeMap

HashMap: (most widely used)
    Upside: speed it's the fastest
    Downside: It does not maintain the insertion order
LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: maintains the insertion order.
    Downside: Slower than HashSet
TreeMap:
    Upside: keeps the data sorted
    Downside: its slower than all
