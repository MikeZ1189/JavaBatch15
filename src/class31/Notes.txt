Working with files:
    if we have to read the data from a file manually on our computers what do we need?
    1) We need to know where the file is stored on our computer
    2) We need to navigate to that folder
    3) We need a software that understands how the data is stored in those files

To create a new directory:
    1) Right-Click on your project name
    2) New -> Directory -> Enter the name
    3) Right-click on you directory -> new -> File
    4) Give name to your file and an extension as  .properties (example ->  config.properties)

Why do we need .properties file:
    we use these file to store information like usernames, password, URLS, database, connection, etc.
    so that this information is secured and is not pushed with the code to GitHub
