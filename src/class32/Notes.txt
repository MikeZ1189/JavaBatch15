FileHandling:
    Reading and writing data to file in Java.
    1) To read or write the data first we need to know the path
    or location where we will be reading or writing that file.
    2) We need to navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so that Java program
        can process the data from the file.
        We use two classes to navigate: FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.

        FileInputStream -> when we have to read the data we use this.
        FileOutputStream -> when we have to write data we use this.
    3) We need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data from that specific file
        Example:
                We use Properties class when we have to read the data from the .properties file.
                When use XSSFWorkBook to read and write the data from Excel files.

Why should we learn about FileHandling?
    1) We will be storing data like username, passwords, URLs, type of browser etc. in configuration files.
    2) When we need to perform data driven testing we will be storing and reading all the data from files like xlsx or csv files.

How to read/write data from files:
    1) get the path
    2) use FileInputStream/FileOutputStream to navigate
    3) use a specialized class like Properties or XSSFWorkBook

What are Exceptions?
    Exceptions are run-tine issues that can stop normal flow of our programs and can abruptly terminate the programs
    which is very bad and leads to bad user experience.

Exception handling:
    We stop the program from terminating abruptly, and we try to mitigate the issue we provide a backup code.
    And convert the error messages to simple text.
