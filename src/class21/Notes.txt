Super keyword:
    "Super" keyword will only work inside the child class
    Is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors
When we should used "Super" or "This" keyword?
    whenever same name field or method exists inside the parent and child class. We can use super keyword to
    explicitly refer to parent class variables methods or constructors.
Notes:
    By default, Java prefers local variables then instance variables from the same class after that
    the instance variables or methods from the parent class.

Method overloading:
    Method overloading happens when same name method exists in a class with different parameters.
    We can overload methods in 3 different ways.
    1) By changing the number of parameters
    2) By changing data types
    3) By changing the sequence of parameters

Why should we overload a method or constructor?
    Clear code and flexibility to the end user.
