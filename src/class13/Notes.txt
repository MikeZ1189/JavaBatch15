When we should use String class?
- when we want to save as much memory as possible and we are okay if the programs ge a little slow.

When should be use StringBuilder class?
- when we want maximum speed and we dont care how much memory out programs going to occupy.

What does it mean by String in immutable?
- something that cannot be changed once created
- It means Strings are not changeable once created in the memory of the computer, and the reason they are
  immutable is because same memory cell can be shared across many variables and if we allow any of the variable to change
  the value it can break the complete system.
