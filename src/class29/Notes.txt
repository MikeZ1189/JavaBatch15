Sets:
    Sets like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet don't allow duplicate values. There are three main types of Sets.
    1) Hashset:
        Benefit: is fast
        Downside: does not retain the insertion order
    2) LinkedHashSet:
        Benefit: retains the insertion order
        Downside: it's slower than HashSet
    3) TreeSet:
        Benefit: it keeps the data sorted
        Downside: it's the slowest
